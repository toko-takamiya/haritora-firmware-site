You must download the firmware file manually (using the \"Manual/download update\" option) and then use the \"nRF Connect for Mobile\" app on {ios} (or {android}, if you wish) to update them.\n\nDownload & run the app, find the device you want to update, go into the \"DFU\" section and select the firmware file you downloaded.

		"why_did_it_not_work": {
			"title": "Why did it not work? // Why is the progress jumping between percentages?",
			"description": "By default, we set up a default that tries to be more reliable when we send data to the devices at the cost of some performance. If it still fails or does not work as expected, try increasing the \"Packet send delay\" option in settings by a small amount (5, 10, etc) - this will make updating slower but more reliable."
		},
		"web_bluetooth_error": {
			"title": "Why do I get a \"web bluetooth is not supported\" error?",
			"description": "This means that your browser does not support Web Bluetooth or it is not enabled. Please ensure you are using a supported chromium-based browser (like Chrome or Edge).\n\nSome browsers like Brave disable Web Bluetooth by default and require changing browser flags (chrome://flags) or do not support it at all (Firefox)."

			"title": "Why can I only update my devices with Bluetooth?",
			"description": "As far as we know, it is only possible to update the trackers via Bluetooth due to firmware limitations. Shiftall may add support for it in the future with a future firmware update, but Bluetooth is needed to update them for now."
